/**
 `CIOAPIClient` provides an easy to use client for interacting with the Context.IO API from Objective-C. It is built on top of AFNetworking and provides convenient asynchronous block based methods for the various calls used to interact with a user's email accounts. The client also handles authentication and all signing of requests.
 
 ## Response Parsing
 
 JSON reponses from the API are automatically parsed into dictionary or array objects depending on the particular API call.
 
 ## Subclassing Notes
 
 As with AFNetworking on which CIOAPIClient is built upon, it will generally be helpful to create a `CIOAPIClient` subclass that contains your consumer key and secret, as well as a class method that returns a singleton shared API client. This will allow you to persist your credentials and any other configuration across the entire application. Please note however, that once authenticated, nearly all API calls are scoped to the user's account. If you would like to access multiple user accounts, you will need to use separate API clients for each.
