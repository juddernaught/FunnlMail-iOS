- storing the latest emails
- storing the list of emails for each filter
- improving email tableview UI. This includes making the email list show green dots for unread messages, as well as the email sender. 
- a log in screen: this should be quite simple to make
- a refresh button everywhere in the app
- pull emails on main screen of app, instead of at every mail view (I'll start working on this)
