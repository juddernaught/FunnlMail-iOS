- storing the latest emails (sqlite or core data)
- storing the list of emails for each filter (is this just tagging the email with the correct filter?)

- improving email tableview UI. This includes making the email list show green dots for unread messages, as well as the email sender. 
 
- a log in screen: this should be quite simple to make (do you have an example login screen from an app you like that we can model the login screen after?)

- a refresh button everywhere in the app (what does this look like? or are we using pull to refresh?)

- pull emails on main screen of app, instead of at every mail view (I'll start working on this) - (not sure what you mean)


UI
-------
- need real icons
- need to breakout colors used in app into constants so the same colors are used everywhere
